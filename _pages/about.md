Hello, welcome to my webpage! I am a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University ([CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}) School of Computer Science ([SCS](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}), studying Societal Computing at Software and Societal Systems Department ([S3D](https://s3d.cmu.edu/){:target="\_blan}). 
I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Nicolas Christin](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/nicolasc/){:target="\_blan} and work with his team at [CyLab](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/){:target="\_blank"} (Security and Privacy Institute). 
My primary research centers on building safe, secure, and private financial systems.Â 
Specifically, my work focuses on detecting and mitigating online misconduct, including market manipulation, phishing, sybil, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
I mainly investigate two key areas: 1) blockchain such as peer-to-peer networks and wallets and 2) online platforms such as social media and digital marketplaces.
I am a recipient of Nakajima Foundation Fellowship (2021-2023, 2023-2025) for my doctoral study.  

Prior to CMU, I did my undergraduate in Japan at Keio University Faculty of Economics and enrolled in the selected all-English undergraduate program: PEARL (Program in Economics for Alliances, Research, and Leadership). 
I also studied in [SOAS University of London](https://www.soas.ac.uk/) for one term in 2017. 

During my undergrad, two of my first author papers on market manipulation were presented at various conferences and published in an international peer-reviewed journal. 
I was also a research assistant at Cyber Civilization Research Center ([CCRC](https://www.ccrc.keio.ac.jp/){:target="\_blank"}), worked with Dr. David Farber and Dr. [Cameron Freer](https://cfreer.org/){:target="\_blank"}, and helped build the new course with MIT Probabilistic Computing. 
I did a long-term internship at Mitsubishi UFJ Bank as an research intern.

Last but not least, I like dogs, rugby, and classical music.
