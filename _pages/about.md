Hello, welcome to my webpage! I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University ([CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}) School of Computer Science ([SCS](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}). 
I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Nicolas Christin](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/nicolasc/){:target="\_blank"} and work with his team at [CyLab](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/){:target="\_blank"} (Security and Privacy Institute). 
My work investigates real-world cybercrime and computer security attacks at scale, particularly those targeting financial systems. 
The examples include denial-of-service (DoS) ([SIGMETRICS'25](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3711697)), address poisoning ([USENIX Security'25](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/tsuchiya)), and fake accounts and fraud ([WWW'24](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589334.3645475), [WWW'23](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583385)). 
<!-- I study system- and software-level attacks such as denial-of-service (DoS) and address poisoning on blockchain. I also research societal threats such as fraud, fake accounts, market manipulation, stolen data, and malicious AI endpoints.  -->
<!-- My research aims to enhance the safety and security of financial services through the lens of computer security. 
I study system- and software-level attacks, including denial-of-service and address poisoning on blockchain, while also addressing societal threats such as Sybil attacks, spam, toxicity, and market manipulation. -->
<!-- My first-author papers have been published at the top-tier computer security and measurement conferences, including USENIX'25, SIGMETRICS'25, WWW'24, and WWW'23.  -->
I am a recipient of the Nakajima Foundation Fellowship and the CyLab Presidential Fellowship for my doctoral studies.

<!-- Prior to CMU, I did my undergraduate at Keio University and enrolled in the selected all-English undergraduate program, PEARL (Program in Economics for Alliances, Research, and Leadership). 
I also studied in [SOAS University of London](https://www.soas.ac.uk/) for one term in 2017.  -->
Previously, I was a research assistant at Cyber Civilization Research Center ([CCRC](https://www.ccrc.keio.ac.jp/){:target="\_blank"}) under Dr. David J. Farber in 2021 and was a research visitor at the University of Cambridge, Department of Computer Science and Technology under Professor [Alice Hutchings](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ah793/{:target="\_blank"}) in 2025. 
<!-- I did a long-term internship at Mitsubishi UFJ Bank as an research intern in 2020. -->

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
