Hello, welcome to my webpage! I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University ([CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}) School of Computer Science ([SCS](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}), [S3D](https://s3d.cmu.edu/){:target="\_blan}, [SC](https://sc.cs.cmu.edu/){:target="\_blan}. 
I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Nicolas Christin](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/nicolasc/){:target="\_blan} and work with his team at [CyLab](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/){:target="\_blank"} (Security and Privacy Institute). 
My primary research focuses on enhancing the safety, security, and privacy in the modern financial systems. 
Specifically, my work delves into the detection and mitigation of online misconduct, including fraud, phishing, and denial-of-service attacks. 
I mainly investigate two key areas: 1) blockchain peer-to-peer networks and wallets (WWW'24), and 2) the online platforms such as social media and digital marketplaces (WWW'23, WWW'24).
I am also a recipient of Nakajima Foundation Fellowship (2021-2023, 2023-2025) for my doctoral study.  

Prior to CMU, I did my undergraduate in Japan at Keio University and enrolled in the selected all-English undergraduate program: PEARL (Program in Economics for Alliances, Research, and Leadership). 
I also studied in [SOAS University of London](https://www.soas.ac.uk/) for one term in 2017. 
During my undergrad, I was a research assistant at Cyber Civilization Research Center ([CCRC](https://www.ccrc.keio.ac.jp/){:target="\_blank"}), worked with Dr. David Farber and Dr. [Cameron Freer](https://cfreer.org/){:target="\_blank"}. 
I did a long-term internship at Mitsubishi UFJ Bank as an research intern.
